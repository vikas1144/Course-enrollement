2. Make sure Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python --version

Run the program:
python course.py

📋 Example Courses
Python Programming
Data Science
Web Development
Machine Learning
Cybersecurity

🧠 Code Structure-
available_courses: List of all available course options
enrolled_courses: Tracks user-selected courses
main(): Menu-based loop for user interaction
Modular functions: show_available_courses(), enroll_in_course(), show_enrolled_courses()
